# DIP-Homeworks
In this class, we learned about some methods and the theory of image processing. We used MATLAB to practice the techniques we learned. 
## DIP_CA1
Spatial resolution, bit planes, histogram operation, transformation and registration
## DIP_CA2
Fourier transforms of images, ideal lowpass and highpass filtering, Gaussian filtering, 
## DIP_CA3
Noise models, Gaussian noise reduction, salt-and-pepper noise reduction, speckle noise reduction
## DIP_CA4
Use MATLAB's Wavelet toolbox along with provided custom functions to perform a series of experiments. In this assignment, we compared execution time, displayed transform coefficient, and detected Wavelet directionality and edge, and smoothed Wavelet-based image.
